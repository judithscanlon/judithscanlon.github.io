# Judith A. Scanlon

I'm new to the world of front-end development and very excited to try all the new techniques and tools available. Right now I'm focusing on the fundamentals - HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

Previously, I helped out family, friends and organizations with their websites including
* The [Junior League of Pittsburgh](https://www.jlpgh.org/) 
* Pittsburgh Knit and Bead (sadly, a shop no longer open for business)  
* [Cruze Architects](http://www.cruzearchitects.com/) &
* the [Explorers Club of Pittsburgh](http://pittecp.org)

I even rescued the [Pittsburgh Consortium of Higher Education website](https://pche-pa.org/) from pirates. Arr!

I'm currently interviewing, so please check out [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judithscanlon/) and get in touch if you need anything.

In the meantime, I'm grateful to [Upstream Coding](https://www.upstreamcoding.com/) for: 
1. the fun I'm having learning new skills 
2. the fantastic hands-on mentoring
3. keeping me off the streets
